            "On the night of October 15, 2021, the defendant, Rajesh Kumar, along with two accomplices, forcibly entered the residence of the victim, Mr. Shyam Lal, located at 45, Andheri East, Mumbai. The intruders overpowered the victim, binding him and his wife, Mrs. Kamla Lal, with ropes. They then proceeded to loot the house, taking cash, jewelry, and other valuable items.\n",

            "During the course of the robbery, an altercation occurred between the defendant and Mr. Shyam Lal. The defendant, in a fit of rage, struck the victim multiple times with a blunt object, resulting in Mr. Lal's death. The assailants then fled the scene with the stolen property.\n",
            "\n",
            "The incident was reported by Mrs. Kamla Lal, who managed to untie herself and call the police. The police arrived promptly and initiated an investigation. Based on eyewitness accounts and forensic evidence, Rajesh Kumar was apprehended within a week and found in possession of several items identified as stolen from the Lal residence.\n",

            "Evidence Presented:\n",

            "Testimony of Mrs. Kamla Lal: The victim’s wife provided a detailed account of the events, identifying Rajesh Kumar as one of the assailants.\n",
            "Forensic Evidence: Bloodstains matching the victim’s blood type were found on the clothes of the defendant.\n",

            "The defense argued that Rajesh Kumar was not present at the crime scene and was wrongfully accused. They suggested that the evidence was circumstantial and that the defendant was a victim of mistaken identity. The defense also highlighted the lack of direct eyewitnesses other than the victim's wife.\n",
            "\n",
            "Prosecution Argument:\n",
            "The prosecution relied on the strong testimonial evidence of Mrs. Kamla Lal, supported by forensic evidence and CCTV footage. They argued that the recovered stolen items found in the possession of the defendant conclusively linked him to the crime. The prosecution emphasized the brutality of the murder and the overwhelming evidence of the defendant's guilt.\n",
